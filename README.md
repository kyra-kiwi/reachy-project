## Plan of action
- Download app: https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/blob/develop/docs/SDK/installation.md
- Watch assembly video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC5Yx950nMY&t=1s
- Assemble robot
- Read and understand documentation from website (example projects)

## Timeline
- 03/01/2026: Assembled Reachy and got [Reachy Mini Control app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/Reachy_Mini#/download) working
- 04/01/2026: Played with Reachy Mini Control App and ran example code (antenna wiggle) in Visual Studio Code

## Getting a sample program running
I got the sample program from here https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/blob/develop/docs/SDK/quickstart.md and ran the following command because I needed the `reachy_mini` library:

```sh
uv pip install "reachy-mini"`
```
